      <p>Optimize Caffe deep learning framework on <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/71992/Intel-Xeon-Phi-Coprocessor-5110P-8GB-1_053-GHz-60-core">Xeon Phi</a>. Optimization will be done by evaluating the performance of CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets. We also plan to make a detailed analysis on the performance of Caffe on Xeon Phi (with and without GPU support).</p>

<p>Caffe Implementation of Convolution Layer:</p>

<p>Caffe implements the convolution of different filters over images in the form of matrix multiplication, it converts the convolutions into a set of matrix multiplications.</p>

<p>Convolution is usually done using a sliding window approach, it is an operation where the filter is applied to each pixel and its neighbours and we get the response at that pixel by adding the multiplication of the corresponding elements at that pixel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/igqoqnogkhd2prq/Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself2.gif?dl=0">Fig 1</a></p>

<p>Thus it is an iterative operation where we have multiple for loops</p>

<pre><code>for w in 1..W
  for h in 1..H
    for x in 1..K
      for y in 1..K
        output(w, h) += input(w+x, h+y) * filter(x, y)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Where the image is WxH size and filter is KXK size</p>

<p>The implementor of caffe was not GPU savvy yet he wished to have his convolution run on a GPU and leverage its many cores to achieve a speedup and train his neural networks faster.</p>

<p>Since he couldn’t easily parallelize the for loops easily, he accomplished this by using a utility much like matlab’s im2col which changes an input 2d array into a set of columns. Each column has the window instance of image and the filter is also represented as columns and then he uses matrix multiplication to get the output.</p>

<p>Of course he pads the image appropriately as per mask size, which you will see if you look at layers in caffe (5x5 filters have a padding of 2 on the image).</p>

<p>CBlas libraries are already available optimised for the matrix multiplication and then col2im is applied back to the matrix multiplication output and we get the convolved image.</p>

<p>The major drawback is having to put these column images in RAM which costs time to transfer to GPU and even takes up shared space.</p>

<p>Our implementation:</p>

<p>We will parallelise the for loops which should save space and we wish to do this for latedays’ XeonPhi processor. We wish to implement the convolution iteratively which the author didn’t do.</p>

<p>We will first be implementing convolution serially and then parallelize the same. If the image in (width X Height) with depth D (Eg: RGB), then each location can be represented as patch of (K X K) which can be interpreted as (K X K X D) vector. M filters are then applied to such a patch. This can be accomplished using multiple for loops in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>for w in Width
  for h in Height
    for i in 1..K
      for j in 1..K
        for m in 1..M
          for d in 1..D
            output(w, h, d) += input(w+i, h+j, d) * filter(m, i, j, d)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We intend to parallelize this implementation by using ISPC, openMP and Pthreads and based on analysis determine which combination of choices at appropriate loops give us the best performance for MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. This will require detailed analysis and evaluation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p><img src="http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/_images/mylenet.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A convolutional neural network is currently a very famous Machine Learning algorithm which is used to classify data. It is especially used in computer vision to classify images with high accuracy. A convolutional neural network applied on an image has multiple axes of parallelism at the different layers of the propagation during the training and testing of the network.</p>

<p>Each hidden layer has multiple feature maps, which are produced by convolving respective weights weighed over all the pixels of the previous layer’s feature maps and adding corresponding results. This convolution task is highly parallelisable. </p>

<p>MaxPooling is a task of subsampling the image by taking the average or maximum amongst subparts of the images. This is done in order to avoid any variance. This task of down-sampling images is also highly parallelisable.</p>

<p>Caffe is a framework written in C++ to implement this convolutional neural network, in order to utilise these axes of parallelism available. Caffe takes the convolutions, uses cblas library to turn them into a bunch of matrix multiplications and the uses CudaDNN with Nvidia GPUs to attain faster training speeds.</p>

<h3>
<a id="challenge" class="anchor" href="#challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenge</h3>

<p>Optimizing Caffe for Xeon Phi is hard as it is already optimized for both generic CPU and GPU. We intend to find specific parts of Caffe implementation that can be optimized to better use the features of Xeon Phi which will be challenging to find. This will require us to understand the existing parallelism support and find new parallelism or fine tune existing support to that of Xeon Phi. </p>

<p>My partner and I have not used or worked with Caffe before and hence we will need to spend time to use and understand the code. Convolution implementation is done by transforming the input data to matrices and computation is done on these. We would need to understand and reimplement this feature to better utilize parallelism of Xeon Phi, which will be challenging.</p>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>Hardware: We will be using Latedays cluster machine that has Xeon Phi co-processor board. We will also be using our laptops to perform initial testing. 
Software: Caffe software which comes with BSD 2-Clause license will be our starting point for this project. Test Data sets: CIFAR-10 and MNIST will also be required for evaluation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="goalsdeliverables" class="anchor" href="#goalsdeliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals/Deliverables:</h3>

<p>Primary goal is to understand and modify the Caffe codebase to best utilize all the resources available in Xeon Phi. We will be evaluating performance with CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets and comparing the same with default Caffe code run on the same machine.</p>

<p>Overall, we would like to gain information about performance benefits of optimizing Caffe on a powerful board such as Xeon Phi. We would also like to gain information about the performance drawbacks of running these optimized code on other machines such as our laptops.</p>

<p>A possible extension is to explore the optimization of Caffe code with GPU support on Latedays cluster.</p>

<h3>
<a id="platforms" class="anchor" href="#platforms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platforms</h3>

<p>We will be using the Linux posix threads framework and ISPC framework to parallelise the caffe implementation for the Xeon Phi processor of Latedays cluster. We will also consider OpenMPI to leverage other 14 cores on Latedays cluster.</p>
